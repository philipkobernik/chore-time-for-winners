CHORE TIME Version 2

VI had no security
V1 had no UI for housemates...

V2 should have security
 -- One owner operator.
 -- Operator should be alerted of responses to house number?

V1 only texts you at the beginning of the week.
V2 should allow multiple alerts per week per chore, customizable...

V2 should have customizable SMS alerts...

V2 should allow housemates to respond with "done" or something like that...

V1 only worked for 1212
V2 should allow anyone to sign up, get a custom phone number for their house, and setup chores, housemates, schedule.

V1 has an arbitrary schedule, basically manually set by philip years ago.
  -> requires equal numbers of chores, housemates
V2 should allow easy modification of the schedule?
  -> should allow different numbers of chores, housemates
  -> it should be easy to adjust schedule, and understand implications...
  -> it generate a schedule for you at first.
